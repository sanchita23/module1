University Admission System
1.	Abstract
University wants to computerize its admission process for higher education courses. 
Basic objectives are to extend their reach to geographically scattered students, reducing time in activities, centralized data handling and paperless admission with reduced manpower. University Admission Management System is a web-based application built with the aim of computerizing the admission procedure in universities and colleges. The system proposed here incorporates handling and management of multi-departmental and multi-divisional system that includes various daily activities in the system.
This project is developed for the purpose of computerization of admission procedure in universities to reduce the time and manpower required in manual admission process. UAMS is developed using Java programming language with HTML/CSS used for user interface, JavaScript for client-side scripting and MS Access for the system database.  The key feature of the system is outlined below:
•	Paperless admission with computerized process
•	Reduced time in activities with reduced manpower
•	Economy
•	Operational efficiency
•	Effective integration with other institutions
1.1.	Existing System
The existing admission management system in universities is generally pen-paper based. Even though some use somewhat computerized system, it is not very effective as the system takes a lot of time and manpower in performing various tasks.
Also, there is no centralized data handling system, so the overall admission procedure becomes very lengthy and tedious as the huge amount of paperwork is very difficult to handle.










1.2.	Proposed System

The Proposed system is a browser which is completely related to internet browsing. The web enabled information management system designed to automate the entire operations of a modern. Being a web-based system, it enables multi-departmental and multi-divisional handling with a centralized system for effective and efficient database management.
2.	Functions
2.1. Administrator
      2.2. Student User
2.3.	 User Interface      
2.4.	 Reports      

3.	Modules Overview:
 3.1. Administrator: Admin of the system has full access and rights to manage the system. They handle all the accounts of students and faculty members. From the back end, admin’s can prepare and submit student reports, college reports, and daily reports of activities in the system.
 3.2. Students: Unlike the admin module, the access to students is restricted to only some sub-modules and functions. Users can see the college list, take hall ticket through online, and view reports prepared by the administrators.
3.4. User Interface: The user interface is a soothing graphical one with context sensitive help. It is fully menu-driven with keyboard shortcuts readily available for commonly user forms.
3.5. Reports: Reports may be student reports, college report or daily reports – these all can be viewed at the click of a button. All reports can be previewed, exported, and printed by students and other users.

6.	Conclusion:
A computerized system provides flexibility, effectiveness and efficiency, plus it proves to be economical in the long run. The proposed university admission management system integrates all the features of a web-based system. As per user requirements, new features and modules can be added to the system.
